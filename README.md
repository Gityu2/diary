## ■Title

4S Diary

## ■Overview

This diary make users grow by simply writing 4 lines a day.

## ■Issue

- Although we think keeping a diary is important, we find it tedious to write.

- Although the diary gets meaningful when we look it back regularly, we find it tedious to do.

- When we spend our days busy studying and working, we miss out on opportunities for growth.
In other words, time has passed without growth.

## ■How to solve these issues

- Provides a simplified diary style that requires only 5 minutes a day to keep going.

- Display the ently to look back.(1 week ago, 1 month ago and so forth)
Also, create a page where users can look back monthly and yearly

- Lower the bar of writing a daily diary and make it a habit.

## ■User benefits

- Users can grow by finding and improving our awareness (growth opportunities) on a daily basis.

- Users will be able to view themselves objectively, which will make it easier to control their emotions and actions. As a result, they will be able to focus on what is necessary for them without letting cravings get the best of them.

- Users will be able to face up to the events (facts) instead of falling into self-loathing. When they are able to find specific areas for improvement and actually improve them, they will feel a sense of self-affirmation, and thier life will enter a positive spiral.

## ■Target

- People who are motivated but unable to continue.

- Those who have a desire to grow, but have difficulty feeling a sense of growth and as a result, suffer from self-loathing.

## ■How to use

Simply write the followings , one line each, for a total of 4 lines.
